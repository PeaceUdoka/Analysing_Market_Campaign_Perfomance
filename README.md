Analyzing_Market_Campaign_Perfomance

## Dataset

The data set contains records of a marketing campaign for the month of January 2018. The campaign was conducted in two groups. One where users were sent personalised messages and the other group as control.

Several campaigns were done on different marketing channels like Emails, House Ads, Push, Instagram and facebook. The purpose of this report is to review the performances of the different channels, generate relevant insights and test if sending personalised messages is a good marketing strategy.

The Dataset was provided as part of the resources for Market Analytics with Python Course on <a href="datacamp.com">DataCamp</a>

Analysis involved feature engineering, exploratory analysis, calculating of customer metrics (conversion rate and retention rate), segmentation and A/B Testing.


## Summary of Findings

During exploration, I found that there was a decline in the conversion rate of house ads from the 11th of January to the end of the month. 
To understand why, I explored the conversion rates of house ads by different segment and discovered that, the decline was as a result of the language error. The language in which the ad was displayed was not the same as the language the users preferred.

Also, from background information, the email campaign was conducted as a test to know whether sending personalised messages to customers is a good marketing strategy or not. Using the lift, t-statistic and p values, I showed how the campaign performed for different age demographics and languages.

The A/B Test showed that the Email strategy of sending personalized messages to customers produced effective results for the younger age group and for English and Spanish speakers.
